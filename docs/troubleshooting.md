# Troubleshooting

## The CoreClaw node is missing after import

Install `n8n-nodes-coreclaw` in the n8n instance, then restart n8n if required by your hosting setup.

## The workflow asks for credentials

This is expected. The public workflow intentionally ships without credential references. Open every CoreClaw node and select your own CoreClaw API credential.

## The run starts but the workflow times out

The Complete workflow polls six times. Increase `wait_seconds` in **Campaign Config** for larger jobs, or use the Starter workflow and build a longer polling or webhook callback flow.

## The export step fails

The CoreClaw node expects `format` to be `csv` or `json`. This template uses `format = csv` and passes `export_filter_keys` as a comma-separated field list.

If the scraper output schema changes, reduce or clear `export_filter_keys` and rerun.

## The run fails with invalid parameters

Check:

- `keyword` is not empty.
- `base_location` is not empty.
- `max_results` is a positive number.
- The CoreClaw scraper still exposes the expected Google Maps keyword schema.
- The workflow includes **Get Current Scraper Details** before **Start CoreClaw Run**.

## Network errors

Confirm the n8n server can reach `https://openapi.coreclaw.com`.

For mainland China local development, see [proxy notes](china-mainland-proxy.md). For overseas self-hosted servers, avoid adding local proxy settings unless your server actually needs them.
